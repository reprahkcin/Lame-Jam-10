## Brief Summary

This was my attempt at a procedurally generated endless runner. Move back and forth, accelerate and brake with the arrows or WASD, jump with the spacebar. The faster you go, the more points you generate. Touching a barrier is a significant deduction.

## Things I didn't finish

* No models for anything
* textures
* various obstacles
* side tracks
* Audio
* Titles
* HUD
* Most everything

# Blue sky upgrades

* steady speed increase and balanced time-based challenge (survival mode)
* Camera follows down lower to make more of a racing game
* animated obstacles
